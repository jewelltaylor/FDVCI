# Function Data Cluster Via Variational Inference
The following R package, FDVCI, was developed as a part of my undergraduate thesis in which I explored applying variaitonal inference to functional data clustering. This novel method of function data clustering was developed by my thesis supervisor, Professor Camila de Souza of the Statistics and Actuarial Sciences Department at Western University. This May I will be working as a Research Assistant at Western University alongside Camila in order to further refine the package in hopes of having our research published.
